Business Risk Measurement

Business risk represents external and internal factors that may lead a company to a reduction of profits or even bankruptcy.

To standardise business risk metrics and enable comparison across firms of different sizes, we can use the coefficient of variation. The coefficient of variation is computed by dividing standard deviation by the mean.

Below is an example on how can we calculate the coefficient of variation for sales:

Revenues Coefficient of Variation = Standard Deviation Revenues / Revenues Mean

By using the coefficient of variation instead of the standard deviation, we can compare business risk across firms of different sizes.

To keep things simple, we will only calculate business risk based on sales, operating income and net income. And we will use the coefficient of variation for that purpose.

We will start with a list of 3 stocks, Apple, Microsoft and Google. Then we will compare business risk across them. Then, we append the extracted values into a list. Each of the list will contain the latest 5 year company revenues, operating income and net income.
